# Task 2 – C++ Basics: Precision, Division, Conditions, Loops

## Description
This program demonstrates several C++ basics:
- Floating-point precision using setprecision
- Integer vs floating-point division
- Type casting (static_cast)
- Checking even/odd numbers and absolute value
- While, do-while, and for loops
- Pre-increment vs post-increment
- Summation from 1 to 100
- User input validation
- Printing squares and simple patterns

The program is divided into multiple tasks (Task 1 to Task 4) inside a single file.

## How to compile

g++ "task 2.cpp" -o task2

## How to run
