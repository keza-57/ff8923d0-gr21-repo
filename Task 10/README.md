# Task 10 - Vector and STL Practice

This repository contains C++ solutions for vector and STL practice exercises. 

## It demonstrates 
- Iterating through vectors using iterators  
- Filling vectors with sequential numbers  
- Sorting vectors in descending order  
- Counting elements based on a condition  
- Calculating sums with lambdas  
- Searching strings by length  
- Inserting elements into the middle of a vector  
- Filtering even numbers from a vector  

All tasks are implemented in task10.cpp using C++.

## How to compile:
g++ task10.cpp -o task10
./task10
