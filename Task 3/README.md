## Description
This program contains multiple small tasks demonstrating:
- Using switch-case with user input (dice simulation)
- Initializing and printing arrays
- Calculating the average of 5 numbers
- Reversing a 1D array
- Filling and printing a 2D array in spiral order (4x4 matrix)

All tasks are implemented in one C++ file.
