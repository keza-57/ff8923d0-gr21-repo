It demonstrates:
- Compile-time factorial and prime checking
- Use of static variables and accumulators
- Functions with multiple default parameters
- Array sorting and median calculation
- Vector filtering and transformations
- String searching and filtering
- Student grade management
- Statistical analysis with outlier removal
- A simple inventory management system

All tasks are implemented in a single source file (task6.cpp).
