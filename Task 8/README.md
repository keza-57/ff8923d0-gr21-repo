# LAB 08 – Pointer Practice Tasks (C++)

## Description
This program implements a set of C++ laboratory tasks focused on pointer fundamentals and pointer-based programming techniques.  
The tasks are designed to strengthen understanding of pointer manipulation, pointer arithmetic, const correctness, pointer-to-pointer usage, 
and using pointers for multiple output parameters.

The program consists of eight independent tasks, all implemented and tested in a single source file.

## It demonstrates:
- Swapping values using integer pointers  
- Finding the maximum value in an array using pointer arithmetic  
- Redirecting pointers using pointer-to-pointer parameters  
- Correct use of const with pointers  
- Reversing arrays in-place using pointers  
- Calculating sums over pointer-defined ranges  
- Working with structures through pointers  
- Returning multiple computed results via pointer output parameters  

All tasks are implemented in a single source file (task 8.cpp).


## How to compile

g++ "task 8.cpp" -o task8
./task8
