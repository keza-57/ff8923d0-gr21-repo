# LAB 09 – C++ Containers and Structures Practice

## Description
This program implements a set of C++ laboratory tasks focused on using standard containers, structures, and basic data processing.  
It demonstrates practical usage of std::vector , std::array, std::map, std::pair, lambda expressions, and nested structures.

The program is divided into several independent tasks, all implemented and demonstrated within a single source file.

## It demonstrates:
- Defining and using custom structures  
- Storing and accessing structured data in vectors  
- Computing sum and average using std::pair  
- Finding minimum and maximum values in fixed-size arrays  
- Managing key–value data using std::map  
- Iterating over containers using range-based loops  
- Using lambda expressions for calculations  
- Nested structures to represent complex objects  
- Counting character frequency using maps  

All tasks are implemented in a single source file (**task 9.cpp**).


## How to compile

g++ "task 9.cpp" -o task9
./task9
