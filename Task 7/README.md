## LAB 07 – C++ Practice Tasks
## Description
This program implements a set of C++ laboratory tasks designed to practice and demonstrate essential programming concepts,
including function overloading, file input/output, reference parameters, recursion, string stream processing, and multi-file data analysis.
The program is divided into seven independent tasks, all implemented and tested within a single source file.

## It demonstrates:
_Function overloading using integer, double, and vector parameters
_In-place modification of vector elements
_Writing structured student records to a file
_Reading numeric data from files and computing statistics
_Use of reference parameters to sort and manipulate values
_String processing using std::stringstream
_Recursive algorithms for array sum and maximum value calculation
_File analysis including line, word, and character counting
_Comparison of multiple files based on computed statistics

All tasks are implemented in a single source file (task7a.cpp).

## How to compile
g++ "task 7a.cpp" -o task7a
./task7a
