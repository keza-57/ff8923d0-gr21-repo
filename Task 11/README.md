# Task 11: STL Vector Operations

## Description
This program demonstrates multiple tasks using C++ STL vectors:
1. Reverse print elements using an iterator.
2. Multiply all elements by a factor.
3. Sort strings by length.
4. Find the maximum value in a vector.
5. Calculate the average of a vector of doubles.
6. Erase all negative numbers from a vector.
7. Merge two sorted vectors into a single sorted vector.
8. Count the number of strings starting with a specific letter.

Each task is implemented as a separate function and tested in the main function.

## How to run:

g++ task11.cpp -o task11
       ./task11
