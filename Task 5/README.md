The program includes:
- A compile_time power function
- A Fibonacci function
- A static counter with reset
- A function with default parameters
- Array statistics (minimum, maximum, average)
- Vector manipulation
- String vector operations
- Temperature statistics



## How to compile
g++ task5a.cpp -o task5a
