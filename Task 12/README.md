# Task 12: Function Pointers and Lambda Operations

## Description
This program demonstrates several tasks using C++ function pointers, lambda expressions,
and pointer arithmetic:

_Apply an operation using a function pointer
_Array of function pointers
_Transform array using a function pointer
_Custom calculation with lambda
_Count elements above threshold
_Double operation with typedef
_Find maximum with custom comparator

Each task is implemented as a separate function and tested in the main function.

## How to run

g++ task12.cpp -o task12
  ./task12
